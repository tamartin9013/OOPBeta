# OOPRelease

OOPRelease is the third and final implementation of the OraclProduction Ltd project. It provides information on the products of a
production line for multimedia devices which include music and movie players. It outputs the product's name,
manufacturer, manufacturing date, serial number, and specific product specifications depending on whether it is an
audio or video product. Print is generic. FindBugs-IDEA returns 0 bugs. CheckStyle returns Javadoc errors.
