# OOP Release
OOP Release is the third and final implementation of the OraclProduction Ltd project. It provides information on the products of a
production line for multimedia devices which include music and movie players. It outputs the product's name,
manufacturer, manufacturing date, serial number, and specific product specifications depending on whether it is an
audio or video product. The program can also recieve employee name and department id inputs and output an employee code and department number. FindBugs-IDEA returns 0 bugs. CheckStyle returns Javadoc errors. 

## Demonstration
In order to use the program, input the employee's first and last name, then their department number, the system will then print what it would save to the console.

## History
The portion of the program that outputs manufacturing information is temporarily commented out. This version takes a name and department id input and outputs an employee user and a reversed department id. The previous functionality is currently disabled by comment blocks in order to focus on developing more recent updates.
